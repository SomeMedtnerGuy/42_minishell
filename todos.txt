Heredoc: if EOF is in quotes:
1. SHould not expand in heredoc 
(INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO TAKE CARE OF. ONLY TRY TO FIX IF ENOUGH TIME)

exit -1 is not considering '-' as number

Maybe: minishell inside minishell prints an extra \n when SIGINT?? (sig in older shells prints \n)

export: flags should have a different error message AND CODE
        +=
        temp can be assigned but not vice-versa

cd: - and ~
