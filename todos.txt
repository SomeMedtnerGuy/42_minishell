MUST:

exit -1 is not considering '-' as number

redirs in parent are permanent!!! (not supposed to lol)

ambiguous redirects are not being taken care of properly



echo $245HOME
- Prints newline, because does not recognize the entire var
- Should sttop at first number and print the rest.


Maybe:

minishell inside minishell prints an extra \n when SIGINT?? (sig in older shells prints \n)
