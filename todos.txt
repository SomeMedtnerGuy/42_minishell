MUST:

redirs in parent are permanent!!! (not supposed to lol)



Builtins:

echo $245HOME
- Prints newline, because does not recognize the entire var
- Should sttop at first number and print the rest.

exit -1 is not considering '-' as number


BUILTINS
expand is breaking when expanding spaces. expand_cmd_env should tokenize differently depending if in quotes or not


Maybe:

minishell inside minishell prints an extra \n when SIGINT?? (sig in older shells prints \n)
