URGENT:
exit -1 is not converting properly
Put delimiter in readline size
several repeated args in export should only create last one? DONE BUT NOT TESTED WITH VALGRIND
export: temp can be assigned but not vice-versa

General: options should be checked first (use is_option())

Maybe: organize export in alphabetical order
Maybe: SHLVL
Maybe: minishell inside minishell prints an extra \n when SIGINT?? (sig in older shells prints \n)
