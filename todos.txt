URGENT:
quotes are not being properly handled in syntax_handler ("||" is being considered a syntax error);
exit -1 is not converting properly
Put delimiter in readline size
cd creates PWD if already not set

Done? General: options should be checked first (use is_option())

export: temp can be assigned but not vice-versa

Maybe: organize export in alphabetical order
Maybe: SHLVL
Maybe: minishell inside minishell prints an extra \n when SIGINT?? (sig in older shells prints \n)
Maybe: ~ ~- ~+ expansions
